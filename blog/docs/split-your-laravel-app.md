# Split your laravel app

Sometimes you work on laravel app project, the app get much bigger by the time, especially when it contains a lot of dependencies between modules, and you remind that each module might be splitted or you deserve to make an app for each module, the last one is not a good way because we soak in redundancy.

It's difficult to maintain all your bussiness logic behind the scence.

Thats why your app deserve to be splitted into packages/modules.

So you can split your modules by creating your packages into your app by yourselves, or 
it recomended to use one of these packages.
