Package installation\n\n\nRun composer require to install Scaffold-Interface:\n\n\nAdd the package to your dependencies in composer.json:\n\n\nrequire : {\n\nAmranidev/scaffold-interface\n: \nv1.5.*\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen update composer:\n\n\n$ composer update\n\n\n\n\nAdd the service providers to config/app.php:\n\n\nAmranidev\\ScaffoldInterface\\ScaffoldInterfaceServiceProvider::class,\nAmranidev\\Ajaxis\\AjaxisServiceProvider::class,\nSpatie\\Permission\\PermissionServiceProvider::class,\n\n\n\n\nPublish the assets in your application with:\n\n\n$ php artisan vendor:publish\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this package publishes:\n\n\napp/Http/Controllers/UserController.php\n\n\napp/Http/Controllers/RoleController.php\n\n\napp/Http/Controllers/PermissionController.php\n\n\nresources/views/scaffold-interface\n\n\npublic/js/scaffold-interface-js\n\n\npublic/css/scaffold-interface-css\n\n\nconfig/amranidev/config.php\n\n\ndatabase/migrations/migration_file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrate for the Scaffold Interface table:\n\n\n$ php artisan migrate\n\n\n\n\nAuth scaffolding:\n\n\n$ php artisan make:auth\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully installed Scaffold Interface!\n\n\nII. Usage\n\n\nTo get access to the interface go to : \nhttp://{your-project-url}/scaffold\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick on new table button and start fill fields, then click on ready and done.\n\n\n\n\nYou have successfully created your entity.\n\n\n\n\nTo migrate your schema just click on migrate button.\n\n\n\n\nWell now you can start usign your entity.\n\n\nTo rollback your entity just rollback its table from database clicking on rollback button first, then click on delete button to be deleted form your app.\n\n\nIII. Relationships\n\n\n1. OneToMany\n\n\nThis package provides a simple short way to generate OneToMany relationship.\n\n\nWe could use our previous example \nProduct\n entity.\n\n\nSo lets create a new entity called \nCommand\n.\n\n\nBefore ending creation, click on OneToMany button, choose product table, choose associated filed and \nclick on OneToMany Button again to be confirmed\n.   \n\n\n\n\nThis will create \nmodel with relation methods ,views, controller and migration file contains foreignkeys\n, for sure you can change whatever you want.\n\n\nThen click on migration button.\n\n\n\n\n2. ManyToMany\n\n\nTo generate ManyToMany relationship between tow tables, click on ManyToMany button, chosse tables from combobox then click on create.\n\n\nWell, this will create a new pivot table schema ready to be migrated, adding ManyToMany raltionship methods to models.\n\n\nThis doesn't create views,controllers and routes, because we belive that each web artisan has his own unique methodology.\n\n\n\n\nIII. Controle Panel AdminLTE\n\n\nScaffold-interface provids a simple controle panel contains user managment system using \nlaravel-permission\n package so menage users-roles-permissions easily.\n\n\nGo a head to terminal and create a new user.\n\n\n$ php artisan tinker\n:\n\n\n$user = new \\App\\User();\n$user-\nname = \njohn doe\n;\n$user-\nemail = \njhondoe@example.com\n;\n$user-\npassword = Hash::make(\npassword\n);\n$user-\nsave();\n\n\n\n\nAdd HasRole dependency to app/User.php:\n\n\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Auth\\User as Authenticatable;\nuse Spatie\\Permission\\Traits\\HasRoles;\n\nclass User extends Authenticatable\n{\n  use HasRoles;\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen click on dashboard button and login.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n\n            \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can determine if a user has a certain role:\n\n\n$user-\nhasRole('writer');\n\n\nYou can also determine if a user has any of a given list of roles:\n\n\n$user-\nhasAnyRole(Role::all());\n\n\nYou can determine if a role has a certain permission:\n\n\n$role-\nhasPermissionTo('edit articles');\n\n\nWant more ? check \nlaravel-permission\n.\n\n\nIV. Pusher Notifications\n\n\n\n\nWhat is pusher ?\n\n\nPusher is a hosted service that makes it super-easy to add real-time data and functionality to web and mobile applications.\n\n\nPusher sits as a real-time layer between your servers and your clients. Pusher maintains persistent connections to the clients - over WebSocket if possible and falling back to HTTP-based connectivity - so that as soon as your servers have new data that they want to push to the clients they can do, instantly via Pusher.\n\n\nPusher offers libraries to integrate into all the main runtimes and frameworks. PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, .NET, Go and Node on the server and JavaScript, Objective-C (iOS) and Java (Android) on the client.\n\n\nPusher is a highly scalable real-time solution established in 2010 and has lots of awesome customers including GitHub, MailChimp, CodeShip, The Financial Times, UserVoice, Travis CI and QuizUp.\n\n\nBefore we get started, \nyou have to create a pusher account.\n\n\nPlease sign up for a free Pusher account via \npusher.com/signup\n, and create a new app via Pusher dashboard.\n\n\nConfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nGo to \n.env\n and define (app_id,key,and secret)\n\n\n\n\nPUSHER_APP_ID = your_app_id\nPUSHER_KEY = your_key\nPUSHER_SECRET = your_secret\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to config/pusher.php and define pusher credentials env.\n\n\n\n\n    'connections' =\n [\n\n        'main' =\n [\n            'auth_key' =\n env('PUSHER_KEY'),\n            'secret' =\n env('PUSHER_SECRET'),\n            'app_id' =\n env('PUSHER_APP_ID'),\n            'options' =\n [],\n            'host' =\n null,\n            'port' =\n null,\n            'timeout' =\n null,\n        ],\n\n\n\n\nChannels \n Events.\n\n\nBy default \nScaffold-Interface\n used \ntest-channel\n as a \nchannel\n and \ntest-event\n as an \nevent\n\n\nBackend\n\n\nSo when you create a new entity, the package creates back-end pusher notification code automatically behind the scenes.\n\n\nCheck the \nEntity Controller\n, we took our previous example entity \nProduct\n.\n\n\n\n\nFrontend\n\n\nThe fornt end code was already defined in \nresources/views/scaffold-interface/layouts/app.blade.php\n.",
